                Open Papers is the desire of an engineering student and his professor to decentralize and democratize
                the process of scientific research paper publication.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
                We believe that the scientific community should be able to collaborate and share their work in an open and accessible manner, free from the constraints of traditional publication models.

                We envision a world where researchers, scientists, and scholars from all backgrounds and institutions have equal access to the latest scientific knowledge and can share their research with the world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-gray-700">
                To achieve this vision, we are building Open Papers - a decentralized community-curated web application for the publication and sharing of scientific research papers.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
                By decentralizing the process of scientific research paper publication, we aim to promote inclusivity, accessibility, and transparency in the scientific community.

                An important factor in this process is anonymity, to avoid any conflict of interest in the review proccess.
                To achieve this, future version of this project should include ZK proofs to assure the anonymity of publishers while still allowing the claiming of ownership if desired.
